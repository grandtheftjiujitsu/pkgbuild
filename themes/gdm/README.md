## Description
These are themes for the legacy version (gdm-old) of the gnome-display-manager.  Screenshots below.  To use a theme, download and unzip the respective tarball.  For more information, see [here on the Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GDM#GDM_legacy).

## Credits
* I have build **none** of these themes from scratch.
* As such see the respective "credits.txt" file for each theme.
* The originals have been modified to my liking and shared here.
