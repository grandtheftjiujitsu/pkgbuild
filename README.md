#### AUR Packages

I'm new to package maintenance so if you find errors, typos, or have other helpful suggestions please feel encouraged to fork and make a pull request.

For installation instructions, see the [AUR page on the Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_packages).

#### Modified (Unofficial) Packages

These packages are made with the [Arch Build System](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Build_System) in a manner similar to [modifying kernels with ABS](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernels/Arch_Build_System).  They are modified for my personal use and not submitted to the AUR.

#### Non-Packaged Compilations

Themes for [Syslinux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Syslinux), [GRUB2](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GRUB), and [LXDM](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/LXDM) that I don't plan to package.  Feel free to download and / or fork and do with them what you please (see their respective license information).

- Syslinux
  - I love the Arch .iso theme so here are links to the [config](https://projects.archlinux.org/archiso.git/tree/configs/releng/syslinux) and [splash image](https://projects.archlinux.org/archiso.git/plain/configs/releng/syslinux/splash.png).
  - Same config looks good with a [rainbow-type](http://www.wallpaperhi.com/Technology/Linux/minimalistic_linux_rainbows_arch_linux_2560x1600_wallpaper_97469) or [pacman inspired](http://technology.desktopnexus.com/wallpaper/39150/) background.
