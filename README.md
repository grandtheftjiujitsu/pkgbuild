# Arch Linux Packages

**Packages and Compilations by savagezen**

#### AUR Packages

I've had to  massively scale down my development projects, however, I still *try* to keep an eye on my original works.  I maintain a very open policy to pull requests, feature suggestions, etc; though my time is very limited and these projects aren't being actively developed.

* *[aur](https://github.com/savagezen/pkgbuild/tree/master/aur])* contains mirrors of packages I maintain.  You can also view them in the [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?K=savagezen&SeB=m)
* For installation instructions, see the [AUR page on the Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_packages).
* *[aur/archive](https://github.com/savagezen/pkgbuild/tree/master/aur/archive)* contains projects I have previously worked on but do not currently maintain.

#### Modified (Unofficial) Packages

Packages in *[abs](https://github.com/savagezen/pkgbuild/tree/master/abs)* are versions  of official packages and AUR packages maintained by other users that have been modified for my personal use.  Typically made with [Arch Build System](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Build_System).

#### Non-Packaged Compilations

*[themes](https://github.com/savagezen/pkgbuild/tree/master/themes)* contains compilations that have not been packaged.  Various screenshots can be found on [Google Photos](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2RH_BSaD6YPY1dZR0x1S2QxZ1U&authuser=0).
